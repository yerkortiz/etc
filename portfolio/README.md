# Portfolio
This implementation is a solution to:
Create a simple Portfolio class that contains a collection of Stock objects and includes a Profit method.
This method should accept two dates and return the portfolio’s profit between those dates.
Assume that each Stock has a Price method that takes a date as input and returns the stock’s price on that date.
Bonus Track: Be able to get the annualized return of the portfolio between the given dates.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Go installed on your machine.

## How to run

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```
Once you run the program, you can pass interactively different values for the quantity of stocks, start and end dates, you can even pass stock prices values.

## How to test

```bash
go test ./portfolio
```
